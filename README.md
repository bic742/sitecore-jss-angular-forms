# sitecore-jss-angular-forms
Angular implementation for Sitecore JSS forms

NOTE: This module is intended to be copied from and extended as needed - it is not meant to be a heavyweight forms implementation.

Consult the [Sitecore JSS documentation](https://jss.sitecore.com/docs/techniques/forms) for further details.

Check out my blog post on details for the implementation: [Implementation Details](https://www.xcentium.com/blog/2020/06/29/sitecore-jss-forms-angular)
